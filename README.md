A Photoshop replacement. Inspired by Keynote. Democratizing design.

##TODO

Phase 1:

* ✓ Move
* ✓ Resize
* ✓ Select
* ✓ Select multiple items
* ✓ Toolbar menu
* Inspector panel (Element/Text/Ruler)
  * ½ Background (direction)
  * ✓ Border
  * ✓ Shadow
  * ✓ Text-shadow
  * Rotation
  * ✓ Opacity
  * ✓ content editable
  * ✓ context menu
  * Font alignment
  * ✓ Font family/size/color
  * ✓ Text-shadow
  * ✓ Text-spacing (line height)

Phase 2:

* ✓ Stage snapping
* ✓ Color picker
* Stage inspector
* ✓ Z-index
* ✓ Copy paste
* ✓ Undo/redo
* ½ Saving/opening

Phase 3:

* Resizing snapping
* ✓ Edge snapping
* ✓ Element snapping
* Pen tool

Nice to have:

* HTML import
* ✓ Keyboard shortcuts
* Versioning
* ✓ Exporting CSS
* Share (dropbox/email?)
* WebFonts
* Layers?
* ✓ Context menu
* Similar distance snapping
* Bootstrap integration

##Elements

* Triangle
* ✓ Rectangle
* ✓ Ellipsis
* Checkbox input
* ✓ Button input
* ✓ Text Input
* ✓ Text
* ✓ Image
* Line

##Fixes:

* Background image
* Background gradient rotation
* Drop image needs background image set
* Color inspector movable window
* Dragging right and up doesn't select elements - offset by the header
* We want the resize to be around the selection?
* ✓ We want the inspector not to completely re-render on selection
* ✓ You can have negative widths

Issue with border radius is that properties are being applied in the wrong order.
Should 'selected' not be a property?
Only save selection in history.
We should have a benchmarking testing library.
